            <h3>Part 3 - Baijiu Modern Transformation</h3>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>Baijiu is China's traditional strong liquor with a history spanning thousands of years. 
                Known for its <strong>high alcohol content</strong>-often over 50%-it was once the <strong>centerpiece of banquets and formal toasts</strong>, 
                symbolizing respect, hospitality, and celebration
            </p>
            <h4>Changing Drinking Habits</h4>
            <p>Younger generations see traditional Baijiu as too strong and too old-fashioned.  
              But this is rapidly changing as Baijiu brands experiment with new flavors and lower-alcohol versions to win over young consumers:
            </p>

              <li><strong>Fruit-flavored Baijiu</strong></li>
             <li><strong>Baijiu lattes</strong> combining coffee culture with tradition</li>
             <li><strong>Baijiu-based cocktails</strong> served in trendy bars</li>
             <li><strong>Baijiu ice cream</strong> blending dessert and alcohol for novelty appeal</li>
